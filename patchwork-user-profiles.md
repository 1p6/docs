This document breaks down who Patchwork is for and how it will help them.


## Guide

### Jobs

Describes the things people are trying to get done in their work or in their life.
A job could be the tasks they are trying to perform and compelte, the problems they are trying to solve, or the needs they are trying to satisfy.

**Functional jobs**

When people try to perform or complete a specific task or solve a specific problem, for example, mow the lawn, eat healthy, write a report, or help clients as a professional.

**Social jobs**

When people want to look good or gain power or status.
These jobs describe how people want to be perceived by others, for example, look trendy as a consumer or be perceived as competant as a professional.

**Personal/emotional jobs**

When people seek a specific emotional state, such as feeling good or secure, for example, seeking peace of mind regarding one's investments as a consumer or achieving the feeling of job security at one's workplace.

**Supporting jobs**

People also perform supporting jobs in the context of purchasing and consuming vlaue either as consumers or as professionals.
These include jobs related to making purchasing decisions, jobs related to posting product reviews and feedback, and jobs related to stopping the use of a product.

### Pains

Pains describe anything that annoys people before, during, and after trying to get a job done or simply prevents them from getting a job done.
Pains also describe risks, that is, potentially bad outcomes, related to get a job done badly or not at all.

**Undesired outcomes, problems, and characteristics**

Pains are functional (eg a solution doesnt work), social ("I look bad doing this"), or ancillary ("it's annoying to go to the store for this").
This may also involve undesired characterstics people don't like ("running at the gym is boring" or "this design is ugly").

**Obstacles**

These are things that prevent people from even getting started with a job or that slow them down ("I lack the time to get this job done accurately" or "I cant afford any of the existing solutions").

**Risks**

What could go wrong and have important negative consequences ("I might lost credibility when using this" or "a security breach would be disasterous for us").

### Gains

Gains describe the outcomes and benefit people want.
Some gains are required, expected, or desired by people, and some would surprise them.

**Required gains**

These are gains without which a solution wouldn't work.
For example, the most basic expectation that we have from a smartphone is that we can make a call from it.

**Expected gains**

These are relatively basic gains that we expect, even if it could work without them.
For example, since the iPhone launched, we expect phones to be well-designed and look good.

**Desired gains**

These are gains that go beyond what we expect, but would love to have if we could.
These are usually gains that people would come up with if you asked them.
For example, we desire smartphones to be seamlessly integrated with our other devices.

**Unexpected gains**

These are gains that go beyond people expectations and desires.
They wouldn't even come up with them if you asked them.
Before the iPhone brought touch screens and the App Store to the mainstream, nobody really thought of them as part of a phone.


## Collected Feedback

### Key quotes

From discussions with potential users.

> The idea of a completely decentralized web is very appealing to me. It's what open source and unix/linux was to the operating system - liberation.

> [I want] the freedom to do things without a corporate walled garden. Be it adult or arty. Both those use cases are so easily destroyed by corporate ecosystems.

> A lot of women are pretty horrifically abused on twitter - fixing that problem while also removing twitter as the ultimate authority on the rules of a twitter-like platform to me is a killer app if you add on all the other things like hackability and being totally open source.

> Browsing-privacy and data-privacy are important to me on the Web.

> I like novel APIs, making money on the side to fund my research, and exploring new paths.

## User survey: Facebook privacy

Using Google's Consumer Surveys, 1000 people were asked, "Would you leave Facebook for a new social network without tracking, data-mining, or advertising?"

 - Yes, I'd leave Facebook: 323 (32.3%)
 - No, I'd stay with Facebook: 372 (37.2%)
 - I'm already off, for privacy reasons: 97 (9.7%)
 - I'm already off, for other reasons: 208 (20.8%)

Let's view the 208 who said, "I'm already off, for other reasons" as non-Facebook-users.
Then let's combine the 323 who said, "Yes, I'd leave Facebook," with the 97 who said, "I'm already off, for privacy reasons," as they represent the same motivation (greater privacy).

 - Have left / would leave over privacy: 420 (53%)
 - Would not leave: 372 (47%)
